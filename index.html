                    We are Lucky 7, a group of Grade 10 students from APEC Schools who were grouped together for our
                    IPBA project focusing on streaming. Our team chose to stream Roblox because it allows us to showcase
                    creativity, teamwork, and fun while playing different games together. Through our stream, we aim to
                    entertain viewers, strengthen our collaboration as classmates, and share the joy that gaming brings
                    to everyone.

                            <h3 class="section-subtitle">I. Summary of Stream</h3>
                            <p>The live stream was conducted on Facebook and featured gameplay from the online gaming
                                platform Roblox. The stream lasted for approximately one hour and aimed to showcase
                                interactive gameplay while observing audience engagement during a live broadcast.</p>
                            <p>At the beginning of the stream, the group played a horror-themed Roblox game inspired by
                                Five Nights at Freddy’s, which focused on suspense-driven gameplay and real-time
                                reactions. After completing the first game segment, the stream transitioned to Shawarma
                                Kiosk, a casual simulation game that offered a lighter and more relaxed experience for
                                viewers. This shift in content helped maintain audience interest and provided variety
                                throughout the stream.</p>
                            <p>The stream utilized in-game sound effects and royalty-free audio to avoid potential
                                copyright or DMCA-related issues. Viewer interaction was observed through reactions and
                                comments during the broadcast. Overall, the live stream demonstrated effective content
                                flow, appropriate audience engagement, and proper streaming practices.</p>
                            <h3 class="section-subtitle">II. Stream Content and Gameplay Analysis</h3>
                            <p>This section analyzes and describes the content and gameplay of the Roblox horror stream.
                                Starting with Shawarma Kiosk, this game relied heavily on atmosphere, dialogue and
                                unexpected events that created psychological horror. The slow pacing and eerie setting
                                built tensions, making players feel uneasy during the simple tasks.</p>
                            <p>In contrast, Five Nights at Freddy’s gameplay focused more on survival mechanics such as
                                monitoring the surroundings through CCTV, managing limited resources and reacting
                                quickly to threats. These different kinds and styles of horror games prevented the
                                stream from becoming monotonous and made the experience dynamic.</p>
                            <p>Player reactions such as fear, confusion, and laughter contributed significantly to the
                                entertainment value. Team communication was essential during the gameplay, especially
                                during tense moments when players needed to warn each other or react quickly to
                                jumpscares. However, some of the gameplay moments slowed down when players were unsure
                                of the objectives.</p>


                            <h3 class="section-subtitle">III. Opportunities for Stream Improvement</h3>
                            <p>Although the live stream was generally successful, improvements could be made to enhance
                                engagement and increase audience reach. Increasing pre-stream announcements and
                                maintaining a consistent schedule could help attract more regular viewers.</p>
                            <p>Some gameplay segments could be smoother if the objectives were clearly explained to both
                                the players and the audience. Clarifying the goals of each game could also improve the
                                overall flow and help maintain audience interest. Additionally, viewer participation
                                could be enhanced through interactive activities such as Q&amp;A sessions and
                                mini-challenges, which would further make the stream more entertaining and engaging.</p>


                            <h3 class="section-subtitle">IV. Well Done Factors</h3>
                            <p>This section figures out what was done well during the livestream. During the stream, one
                                of the things that was done well was the gameplay, as the streamers played consistently
                                without delay or mistakes. The reactions of the streamers were priceless and realistic,
                                showing that the stream was done smoothly.</p>
                            <p>Another thing that went well during the stream was the streaming software as the
                                streamers were able to use it easily without any problems. The layout of the stream from
                                the streaming software was perfect and the software itself was used greatly without any
                                errors.</p>


                            <h3 class="section-subtitle">V. Factors Contributing to Reduced Viewership</h3>
                            <p>The stream’s relatively low viewership, totaling 121 viewers, can be attributed to
                                limited promotional efforts and inconsistent streaming schedules. Promotion was
                                restricted to only two Facebook posts, which limited audience awareness prior to the
                                event. Furthermore, the absence of a fixed streaming time reduced viewer availability.
                                Consequently, the stream reached a smaller audience compared to streams that are
                                consistently promoted and scheduled during peak viewing periods.</p>
